The specification book serves as a comprehensive guide for both the development team and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding project requirements and expectations.


== Task and objective

To expand its business model, the Bookstore Schiller needs a web application for selling and managing books. However, the managing director and her colleagues still have some further ideas.

In addition to user management, the application also requires item management. For each book, at least the author, the publisher, the ISBN, a short description of the contents, and an image of the book volume must be saved. The books in the Bookstore Schiller are divided by genre into the categories Fiction, Non-Fiction, Entertainment and Self Help. A possibility to add and edit genres later is desirable. The managing director is also thinking about offering other items such as merchandise or calendars. It is desirable to be able to add categories afterwards so that new items can be continually added to the range. There are no subcategories. The idea is that there are several general categories, such as books, calendars, and merchandise. Items can be assigned to multiple categories. If the store decides to also offer postcards, for example, this category should be able to be added dynamically at runtime. After adding the category, it should of course also be possible to assign the article to this category when adding new articles. Categories should describe attributes of the items. New categories should be able to be added to the administration system by both admins and employees.

Given the variety of products on offer, the admin should be provided with an inventory management system. An interface or an import/export mechanism for item management, e.g. for mass updates, is not required. The inventory is entered manually by employees. New books and goods are ordered outside of the system being implemented. Once the goods have arrived, the new inventory level should be entered using a form. The overview should be able to be filtered/sorted according to existing quantities so that employees can see what needs to be reordered.

The user administration should provide the most important information (name, identification number, delivery address, orders, etc.) and also offer the option of processing this data. Registered customers are therefore able to change their most important information, such as address and contact options. Within a user administration, admins should have the opportunity to add, edit and remove new employees. When it comes to managing customers, not only the admin, but also other employees have access rights so that they can also view user profiles. Registration should be open to everyone, i.e. registration can be done proactively by the customer and without the supervision of an employee. However, expectations regarding the security of user profiles must be taken into account. Therefore, when a new customer registers, their password is checked based on various security criteria. This results in the following roles: Admin, Employee, Unregistered User and Registered User.

Registered Users schiller.order themselves using the shopping cart and select how they want to pay. After payment and shipping or collection, the schiller.order is completed. Payment by invoice and cash are sufficient, no further integration is necessary. When paying by invoice, it is important that open payments can be displayed in the employee view and can be set to paid so that employees know what still needs to be sent or picked up. In schiller.order to maintain an overview of schiller.order and payment processing, employees at the Bookstore Schiller should be able to see the status of each schiller.order in a summarized overview. For example, successful shipping and successful payment can be checked and recorded. For online orders, the items sold still need to be shipped. The employees do this manually after receipt of payment and mark the schiller.order accordingly.

As an additional feature, the Bookstore Schiller would like to have a calendar on the homepage that lists the weekly readings that take place in the bookstore's rooms. There should also be an overview page with details for each event. Users can book to reserve a place for a reading if they are already registered at the Bookstore Schiller. Users should also be able to manage their reservation, e.g. cancel or change it. The following information should be displayed for each event on the overview page: location, time, title, and description. Employees should also be able to edit and delete the event. Another essential piece of information for every event is the maximum number of participants, which should be stored separately from the room, as different events require or prefer different capacities, regardless of the room. When the admin creates events, the maximum capacity can also be specified in addition to the location.

== Product Usage

This section is going to give an overview of how the product is intended to be used upon completion and under which circumstances.

The system is going to be used as a web shop by Schiller to sell books, merchandise, calendars and to book events. The software is supposed to run on a server and be available through the internet (via a browser) to interested customers 24/7.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following desktop (and mobile if applicable) browsers:

Mozilla Firefox, version 92.0.1+

Google Chrome, version 94.0.4606+

Safari, version 5.1.7+


The primary user of the software is an customer, who supposedly knows typical website navigation schemas, as well as administrators (Boss), who do not necessarily have a technical background.

The system shall only need minimal maintenance and new features will be rolled out upon request as the students of group 32 have to satisfy the needs of their next customer. Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application (e.g. no SQL knowledge should be required for a boss).

== Stakeholders
This section lists every group or individual (either real or juridical) that has an influence on the system requirements. In the table below, these stakeholders are listed, a priority is assigned (in case requirements conflict, this enables easier decisions), and their high-level goals are described.

Assigned priorities range from 1 (lowest priority) to 5 (highest priority).

== System boundary and top-level architecture

=== Context Diagram
A context diagram provides a high-level visual representation of a system's architecture and its interaction with external entities or actors. It's primarily used in the early stages of software development to help stakeholders, including those without a technical background, understand the scope and boundaries of a system. By depicting the system as a single entity and showcasing its interactions with external actors, the context diagram helps in setting clear expectations and reducing potential misunderstandings.

*System Representation:* The main system is represented by the large rectangle labeled "Bookstore SCHILLER (from Bookstore SCHILLER)." This is the core of the software solution we are developing.

*External Entities/Actors:* Surrounding the main system, we see various external entities that interact with the system. These are:

- *Unregistered User:* Unauthenticated Users who use the bookstore. These are visitors who use our website.
- *Registered User:* Users who have been authenticated and therefore have a registered account. They have access to further functionalities such as purchasing items, for example.
- *Admin:* Represents users with higher privileges or access levels, responsible for managing or overseeing the system.
- *Employee:* Represents staff members or individuals responsible for day-to-day operations or tasks within the system.

In the example of the user, a deliberate distinction is made between registered and unregistered users. The “User” class can still be found as an auxiliary class in the data model.

=== Top-Level Architecture
In the realm of software development, the Top-Level Architecture serves as a high-level blueprint of the system, highlighting its principal components and their relationships. It performs several crucial functions:

*Holistic Overview:* This architecture provides stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the system's structure without delving into intricate details.

*Component Interaction:* It demonstrates how different parts of the system communicate and interact with one another.

*Guidance for Developers:* It acts as a guide for the development team, helping them understand the primary building blocks they will work on and how they interconnect.

*Stakeholder Communication:* For non-technical stakeholders, the Top-Level Architecture simplifies the complex nature of the system into understandable chunks, allowing for informed decision-making.

Looking at the diagram, think of the "Bookstore SCHILLER" as a digital bookstore. Here's a breakdown of its architecture:

- *Catalog:* This is like the display shelves in a physical bookstore. It showcases the books and other items available for purchase.
- *Event Calendar:* Think of this as a calendar hanging in the store, informing you of upcoming book readings or other events at the bookstore.
- *Shopping Cart:* Just as you might use a cart to gather books in a physical store, this component allows users to collect and manage items they wish to purchase online.
- *Inventory Management:* Behind the scenes, this component keeps track of how many copies of each book are in stock, ensuring that the store doesn't sell more than it has.
- *Event Management:* This manages the logistics and details of the events advertised in the Event Calendar.
- *Order and Payment Processing:* Once you've chosen your books and are ready to make a purchase, this component handles the transaction, ensuring your payment is processed and the schiller.order is recorded. Furthermore, it allows employees to get an overview of all orders and their status.
- *User Management:* This is the bookstore's way of recognizing you. It manages user profiles, booked events, and purchase histories, much like a store loyalty program.

== Use-Cases

This section will give an overview of the use cases the system has to support. These use cases describe what functionality the system has to provide (mostly) from the client’s point of view and which actors are involved.

=== Actors

Actors are users of the system or neighboring systems who/which access it. The following table summarizes all actors of the system and provides a description of the actor. Abstract actors (i.e. an actor which groups other actors, written in italic) are used to generalize and group.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name |Beschreibung
|_User_  |Representative for every person who interacts with the system, regardless if authenticated or not. This includes all the following actors in the table.
|_Customer_ | Representative for every person interacting with the bookstore website with the intent to purchase books and products or book events. Customer encapsulates both Registered Users and Unregistered Users.
|Unregistered User |Representative for a _Customer_ who has not yet been authenticated and therefore does not yet have a user account in the system.
|Registered User |Representative for _Customers_ who have been authenticated and therefore have a user account in the system.
|Admin |Representative for _Users_ who are registered and authenticated as "ADMIN". They are responsible for the administration of the application.
|Employee |Representative for _Users_ who are registered and authenticated as "EMPLOYEE". They serve the client by running the bookstore and therefore also have some administrative rights.

== Non-Functional Requirements

This section is going to give an overview of non-functional (NF) requirements of the
bookstore. These requirements describe how the system works and within which boundaries
it is supposed to perform.

=== Quality Demands

The following table shows what quality demands have to be fulfilled to which extent.
The first column lists the quality demands, while in the following columns an "x" is used to mark the priority.
The assigned priority has to be considered in the formulation of the concrete non-functional requirements.

1 = Not Important ..
5 = Very Important

== GUI Prototype

The following images serve to give the client an idea of what the Bookstore Schiller website is going to look like. While they are not the final designs (i.e. there will still be minor changes as for the naming of buttons, for example), they are to be a guide for the general feel of the website and what the navigation will look like. With time, more prototypes will appear in this section of the Pflichtenheft, serving also as a navigation to developers who want to know how their program will be visually implemented.

=== Overview: Dialog Map
//Die nachfolgende Abbildung zeigt eine an die Pinnwand gezeichnete Dialoglandkarte. Ihre Karte sollte zusätzlich die Buttons/Funktionen darstellen, mit deren Hilfe Sie zwischen den Masken navigieren.

The following dialog maps illustrate the navigation through the Bookstore Schiller website, and what functionalities are available depending on User role. 
Large rectangles represent pages on the website, whereas small rectangles represent subviews that aren't accessible as individual pages on the website. 


*Navigation available to User (Customer)*

image:models/analysis/GUI/UserView.png[]
User is able to access all website pages from the "Home" page. While all pages can also be accessed from all other pages, "Home" is the intended center point for navigation. The diagram is also supposed to stay readable and simple. 
To see the prototypes for the individual website pages, please see section "GUI Prototypes". 


*Cart ("Warenkorb") subviews*

image:models/analysis/GUI/CartSubviewsv2.png[]

This diagram shows the two different ways a User can navigate a purchase. On the left, the User is a Registered User (has logged in already) and can therefore immediately navigate to the payment confirmation. On the right, the User has not yet logged in, and is therefore prompted to do so before being able to proceed. 
To see the prototypes for the individual website pages, please see section "GUI Prototypes". 


*Navigation available to logged-in Admin*

image:models/analysis/GUI/AdminView.png[]
Admin is able to access all administrative website pages from the "Home" page, given they are logged in. While all pages can also be accessed from all other pages, "Home" is the intended center point for navigation. The diagram is also supposed to stay readable and simple.
To see the prototypes for the individual website pages, please see section "GUI Prototypes". 

In schiller.order to illustrate the functionality of buttons and inputs on the website, as well as give a visual representation of the website navigation, the following diagrams have also been included.


*Example navigation from "Home" page to "Produkt Details"*
