== 1. Introduction and Goals
=== 1.1. Task Definition

To expand its business model, the Bookstore Schiller needs a web application for selling and managing books. However, the managing director and her colleagues still have some further ideas.

In addition to user management, the application also requires item management. For each book, at least the author, the publisher, the ISBN, a short description of the contents, and an image of the book volume must be saved. The books in the Bookstore Schiller are divided by genre into the categories Fiction, Non-Fiction, Entertainment and Self Help. A possibility to add and edit genres later is desirable. The managing director is also thinking about offering other items such as merchandise or calendars. It is desirable to be able to add categories afterwards so that new items can be continually added to the range. There are no subcategories. The idea is that there are several general categories, such as books, calendars, and merchandise. Items can be assigned to multiple categories. If the store decides to also offer postcards, for example, this category should be able to be added dynamically at runtime. After adding the category, it should of course also be possible to assign the article to this category when adding new articles. Categories should describe attributes of the items. New categories should be able to be added to the administration system by both admins and employees.

Given the variety of products on offer, the admin should be provided with an inventory management system. An interface or an import/export mechanism for item management, e.g. for mass updates, is not required. The inventory is entered manually by employees. New books and goods are ordered outside of the system being implemented. Once the goods have arrived, the new inventory level should be entered using a form. The overview should be able to be filtered/sorted according to existing quantities so that employees can see what needs to be reordered.

The user administration should provide the most important information (name, identification number, delivery address, orders, etc.) and also offer the option of processing this data. Registered customers are therefore able to change their most important information, such as address and contact options. Within a user administration, admins should have the opportunity to add, edit and remove new employees. When it comes to managing customers, not only the admin, but also other employees have access rights so that they can also view user profiles. Registration should be open to everyone, i.e. registration can be done proactively by the customer and without the supervision of an employee. However, expectations regarding the security of user profiles must be taken into account. Therefore, when a new customer registers, their password is checked based on various security criteria. This results in the following roles: Admin, Employee, Unregistered User and Registered User.

Registered Users order themselves using the shopping cart and select how they want to pay. After payment and shipping or collection, the order is completed. Payment by invoice and cash are sufficient, no further integration is necessary. When paying by invoice, it is important that open payments can be displayed in the employee view and can be set to paid so that employees know what still needs to be sent or picked up. In order to maintain an overview of order and payment processing, employees at the Bookstore Schiller should be able to see the status of each order in a summarized overview. For example, successful shipping and successful payment can be checked and recorded. For online orders, the items sold still need to be shipped. The employees do this manually after receipt of payment and mark the order accordingly.

As an additional feature, the Bookstore Schiller would like to have a calendar on the homepage that lists the weekly readings that take place in the bookstore's rooms. There should also be an overview page with details for each event. Users can book to reserve a place for a reading if they are already registered at the Bookstore Schiller. Users should also be able to manage their reservation, e.g. cancel or change it. The following information should be displayed for each event on the overview page: location, time, title, and description. Employees should also be able to edit and delete the event. Another essential piece of information for every event is the maximum number of participants, which should be stored separately from the room, as different events require or prefer different capacities, regardless of the room. When the admin creates events, the maximum capacity can also be specified in addition to the location.

=== 1.2. Quality Demands

The following table shows what quality demands have to be fulfilled to which extent.
The first column lists the quality demands, while in the following columns an "x" is used to mark the priority.
The assigned priority has to be considered in the formulation of the concrete non-functional requirements.

1 = Not Important ..
5 = Very Important

=== 2.3. Product Usage
This section is going to give an overview of how the product is intended to be used upon completion and under which circumstances.

The system is going to be used as a web shop by the Bookstore Schiller to sell books and merchandise.
The software is supposed to run on a server and be available through the internet (via a browser) to interested customers 24/7.

The primary user of the software is an customer, who supposedly knows typical website navigation schemas, as well as administrators (Boss), who do not necessarily have a technical background.

The system shall only need minimal maintenance and new features will be rolled out upon request as the students of group 32 have to satisfy the needs of their next customer. Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application (e.g. no SQL knowledge should be required for a boss).

== 3. Context and Scope
=== 3.1. Context Diagram

A context diagram provides a high-level visual representation of a system's architecture and its interaction with external entities or actors. It's primarily used in the early stages of software development to help stakeholders, including those without a technical background, understand the scope and boundaries of a system. By depicting the system as a single entity and showcasing its interactions with external actors, the context diagram helps in setting clear expectations and reducing potential misunderstandings.

*System Representation:* The main system is represented by the large rectangle labeled "Bookstore SCHILLER (from Bookstore SCHILLER)." This is the core of the software solution we are developing.

*External Entities/Actors:* Surrounding the main system, we see various external entities that interact with the system. These are:

- *User:* Represents individuals or other systems that will be using the bookstore website. User encapsulates users who interact with the website for various reasons or our staff.
- *Unregistered User:* Unauthenticated Users who use the bookstore. These are visitors who use our website.
- *Registered User:* Users who have been authenticated and therefore have a registered account. They have access to further functionalities such as purchasing items, for example.
- *Admin:* Represents users with higher privileges or access levels, responsible for managing or overseeing the system.
- *Employee:* Represents staff members or individuals responsible for day-to-day operations or tasks within the system.

== 4. Solution Strategy
=== 4.1. Quality Demand Fulfillment
[options="header"]
|===
|Quality Demand |Solution approach

|Maintainability a|
* *Modularity* Application is composed of discrete, loosely coupled components. According to the principles of low coupling, high cohesion.
* *Reusability* Components are designed for reuse in different parts of the application or in different projects. 
* *Modifiability* The application is easy to modify and extend, with minimal risk of introducing errors.

|Usability a|
* *Error Handling* The system provides clear error indication to the user. For example, when she or he enters the wrong credentials.
* *User Interface* The interface is aesthetically pleasing and engaging for the user.
* *User Experience* The system is intuitive, easy to navigate and provides relevant context to the user.  
* *Accessibility* The system is accessible to users with visual impairements, by making use of various images, enlarged fonts and color contrasting.

|Security a|
* *Confidentiality* Ensure that only data can be only accessed by people who are authorized to access them. This can be realized with _Spring Security_ and _Thymeleaf_ (`sec:authorize` - tag).
* *Integrity* Prevent unauthorized modification of data. This can be realized with _Spring Security_ (`@PreAuthorize` - annotation).
* *Accountability* All user actions are logged, ensuring traceability and accountability.

=== 4.3. Architecture decisions

==== 4.3.1. Design Patterns
* Spring MVC

==== 4.3.2. Persistence
The application uses *Hibernate annotation based mapping* to map Java classes to database tables. As a database, *H2* is used.
The persistence is deactivated by default. To activate persistence storage, the following two lines in the file _application.properties_ have to be uncommented:
....
# spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:./db/schiller
# spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
....

|===

The decision to adopt the UniqueInventory model in our Java Spring Application for the bookstore stems from the need for a simple and intuitive inventory management system. By opting for a one-to-one relationship between products and InventoryItems, mirroring a centralized warehouse approach, we aim to streamline the understanding of stock levels. The Quantity attribute in the InventoryItem directly corresponds to the available items for a specific product, providing clarity and simplicity in inventory tracking.

In contrast, the MultiInventory alternative, accommodating a one-to-many relationship, introduces complexity, particularly in scenarios involving multiple warehouses. While this model might be suitable for diverse warehousing setups, its implementation complicates processes like order completion. Unlike the UniqueInventory, the MultiInventoryItems are not automatically adjusted upon order completion, necessitating additional logic to handle quantity reduction, unnecessary for a single bookstore.
